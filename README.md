# Ball-Battle
A game about units getting the ball into the enemy gate.

# Known Issues
Sometimes the collision between attacker and defender won't work, resulting in either only the attacker or defender getting inactivated, or none getting inactivated when they're supposed to.
The inconsistency in its occurence has made it hard to reproduce and debug.
